# CMPE-256 Individual Project
# Social Relationship Recommendation

The social relationship recommender is built to analyze what features influences to have a passion towards someone or to maintain a healthy relationship with the opposite sex. The few factors that were considered to approach this were how different are the people responding to the racial background, how important are the shared interests among them and how important did the attractiveness of the partner plays a role.

# DataSet

Data were collected from participants on an event of experimental dating dates back to 2002-2004 where the attendees would be introduced to their first four-minute date with an attendee of the opposite sex. They were also asked to rate their date on six features namely Attractiveness, Sincerity, Intelligence, Fun, Ambition, and Shared Interests.
The dataset also includes questionnaire data gathered from participants at different points in the process. These fields include demographics, dating habits, self-perception across key attributes, beliefs on what others find valuable in a mate, and lifestyle information.
